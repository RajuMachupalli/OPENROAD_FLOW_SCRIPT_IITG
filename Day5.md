# Session 1: FPGA based Accelerator Prototyping by Prof. Sachin B. Patkar, IIT Bombay
-> Introduction to FPGA architecture.
-> Overview of FPGA based projects at his labs:
    1. Multi-FPGA design.
    2. 
    3. FPGA based acceleration of circuit simulation
    4. Hardware acceleration of POSIT-arithmetic for RISC-V-SOC.
    5. Quills: A Coprocessor for error-free linear algebra.
    and lot of projects his lab is working


# Session 2: The memory system by Dr. Jose, IIT Guwahati
Role of memory in high performance computinh unit.
Memory Hierarchy
  1. Cache memory: small and fast buffer between processor and next level mmemory. Works on principler of locality, Temporal locality, Spatial locality.
  2. Cache Architecture: tag, set and lines
  3. Cache addressing:
